# Overview of the todo-app

After I found some free time, I reviewed the application and started in order to improve the its features, fix some bugs, and enhance some features.

- Todo items deleted all new entries

  - _Issue:_ After the insertion of the seeds data file, that is loaded in the application initial load, all news todos were being deleted at once.
  - I realized that the IDs for the new entries were not being generated.
  - After generating the new ID based on the previous item ID I have configured the delete function to target the correct `item.id`.

- Prevent Duplicate todos
  - _Issue:_ There is no duplicate items logic, therefore, a single item name could be added causing duplication.
  - I created a simple function that runs inside of onSubmit where it checks the todoItems list for an recurring instance of the todo item.
  - Then, I created a conditional to check is the duplication is true display a isDuplicate msg, clear the input value and allows the user to re-enter a value.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
